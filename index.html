          <h2>Why Paws Need Claws</h2>
            <p>
              "DECLAWING" (onychectomy) IS TEN SEPARATE, PAINFUL AMPUTATIONS OF THE LAST DIGIT OF A CATS FINGER including bone (third phalanx), dorsal ligaments, flexor tendons, connective tissue, blood vessels, nerves, claw, and fur. Because claws grow directly out of claw forming bone, "declaw" surgery has to irreversibly carve out and sever, by either a scalpel, nail trimmer, or burned off with a CO2 laser light, the third or distal phalanx to keep the claw from growing back. It's literally "de-fingering", "dis-jointing" and "dis-membering" the last digit of a cat's finger including the outmost joint bone.
            </p>
